## Manual Installation

If your server doesn't have access to the internet, you can download the [latest plugin binary release](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-splunk/releases) and upload it to your server via **System Console > Plugin Management**. The releases on this page are the same used by the Marketplace. To learn more about how to upload a plugin, see the [Mattermost Developer documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/plugins/using-and-managing-plugins/).
